Recent Events (recent events section not ratifying)

Notes:

* This report assumes Jason did not flip Rance's master switch to Agora
  on 2020-02-11. This is related to whether zombie auctions work. The
  judgement of CFJ 3793 is expected to contain an opinion on this.

* This recent events section assumes that three master switches were
  flipped on January 7 rather than some time last month.
