*This is the current IRC forum. We may replace it with another, but in
the long run one IRC channel or another will be made a discussion forum.

**The forum is specifically just that email list. From the message that
made it public: "Note that although groups.io provides many features
besides email, the forum I am referring to is specifically the email
list: if something doesn't get to Gio's subscribers by email, it wasn't
sent via Gio.

The IRC channel does not require subscription; set your IRC client to
server irc.libera.chat, port 6667, channel ##nomic, and whatever
nickname you like.

You can subscribe to GIO by messaging the following email
main+subscribe at agoranomic.groups.io
